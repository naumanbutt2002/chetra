Chetra is a modern, Instagram-like social media application developed using Flutter and backed by Firebase for authentication and real-time data handling. It features a robust media-sharing experience where users can upload and explore posts, photos, videos, and stories, all managed through Firebase Firestore. To ensure optimized storage and scalability, all media files are seamlessly stored and served using Cloudflare R2. The app emphasizes performance and clean architecture, incorporating state management with Provider and offering a visually rich, responsive UI inspired by popular social platforms.
